            My name is Christian Watson. I was pursuing a degree in Computer Science in 2022 until circumstances pushed me towards self-study. I have an interest for technology and I am occasionally looking to learn more about it. 
            I am currently learning about web development, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing games, reading, and spending time with my friends and family.
            I hope to one day work in the tech industry, and I am excited to see what the future holds.</p>
